# DESCRIPTION
* This web app implements [The Strain API](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/dankabase.git), allowing users to search for Marijuana Strains and their corresponding details.
* Also utilizes the [Leafly](https://www.leafly.com/) website (not their API).
* After searching for a Strain using the [The Strain API](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/dankabase.git) a user can click a link that will take them to the [Leafly](https://www.leafly.com/) URL end point for the particular Strain to find where (if possible) they can purchase it from.
  *  This functionality is accomplished using a [Regex function](https://github.com/ryanglenferris/dankabase/blob/527c7b030d51954f284e2703bf3cbcf204efaf2c/app/src/index-interface.js#L50-L74) that creates the Leafly URL endpoint based on the name of the Strain.
